Packing and unpacking our luggage five times in the past two weeks on Monday finally we set foot to our permanent accomodation in The Olivian!

Although there was still a lot on our to do list we have enjoyed the semi-sunset on the rooftop terrace. Semi as there is a huge hotel between us and the sunset.

Moritz was much entertained by the planes passing by our head. It is crazy that they direct their air traffic above the city!

I have missed only one thing during my extensive research on the housing market. The construction. Apparently next to our apartment complex one can see the probably largest construction site in the city. Apparently the construction itself is silent during the day. When night comes though huge tracks and noisy work starts. GREAT!

On Thursday after 3 days of rain finally the sun kind of came out. I took the opportunity and visited the beach area of Seattle. Yes indeed Seattle has some beaches! 
The bus dropped me in a not so exciting shopping area. Surrounding it were huge houses and great gardens and finally I also saw those famous American streets were it is very easy to drive. 
Some parts of the walk the water front was claimed private property, but most way I could walk next to the sea. The walk reminded me of the days in Istanbul. On the way I saw (probably the best) view of Seattle downtown.

I had the best vegan ice cream I ever tasted. Just don’t ask its price please!

I like this area as much as to return the next day when I explored the Lincoln park and its neighborhood.
