Our weekend target is to explore the Olympic National Park and our limits in terms of tent size. We left the city early Friday afternoon. We wanted to arrive before dark to Lake Quinault as we needed to find a camp site and set up our tent. To begin with we were aiming to try our new tent in a car tenting setup. This meant to park somewhere and open the tent right next to the car. Okay, however most of the tent sites you need to book well in advance. Especially in the Olympic National Park 3 or 4 months in advance. Well. Some campings offer a last minute drive in camp sites our aim was to grab one of these near Lake Quinault. 

I guess sleeping in a tent was not equally well received by both parties...

The reason we came here this weekend is to meet up and hike this area with friends from The Netherlands. Felline and Rico are spending their holidays doing a road trip between Seattle and San Francisco. They have choosen Lake Quinault as the first stopover of their adventure. 
     
We had two small hikes with them on Saturday to explore the rainforest of the Olympic Penisula.

**Hey, those trees are huge here!**
Word’s third largest sprouce tree could be found close to our little cottage. The sprouce tree can tipically be found in the area called tempered rainforest. This type of forest exists only in the Pacific Northwest. Thus being the 3rd largest in the word practically means being the 3rd largest in the Pacific Northwest.
