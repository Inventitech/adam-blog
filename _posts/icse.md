**This week, I headed over the big pond to Montreal for ICSE. I was
  invited to present at a student mentoring workshop there (to give
  advice to current and prospective PhD students) and to present our
  [paper on Blackchain-based Software
  Engineering](https://inventitech.com/publications/2019_beller_hejderup_blockchain-based_software_engineering.pdf).**

  to structured training.

At least I made good use of the gym in our hotel (I chose it
specifically for that reason ... and because it was cheap) and trained
there 4 times over the course of the week -- this is the most training
I could ever get in during an ICSE, I think. I never really trained
for longer than 1 hour, but I did some of that urgently needed
strength training and could get some intervals on the recumbent
ergometer.

That thing's power meter was way off, by the way. I barely managed to
do 130 Watts on it. Plus, I did not like the recumbent
geometry. Still, better than nothing.

Tot zo,
