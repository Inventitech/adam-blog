**For Timea's birthday (and Easter), the weather turned out just as
  ordered: three beautiful days full of sunshine here in the
  The Netherlands. As Timea and I had some [empty spots on our cycling
  map](/starting) in the north, Timea designed an exceptionally nice
  3-day tour through the Northern Netherlands -- that means through
  the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen in particular.**

After [a stay in the excellent Ijsvogel
Hotel](https://www.landhoteldeijsvogel.nl) (make sure to have dinner
there!), Day number 2 saw us cycling through Friesland. Friesland is
of course known for its own language, and most regions are [classified
as speaking Frisian, not Dutch,
dialects](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland#/media/File:Taalsituatie_Noord-Nederland.png). As
a result, I failed to pick up even a single word from the Frysian
conversations I overheard. On the flipside, everyone I spoke Dutch to
was very easy to understand.

Another interesting discovery was that people seemed to rather want to
speak German than English, probably a cause of this (and the many
German tourists). This is very different in most of South- and
North-Holland where the high number of internationals from everywhere
means English is the immediate go-to (even though a considerable number
of Dutch still speak German well there, too).

One thing that amazes me about the Netherlands is that animals, and
birds, in particular, seem to have lost all fear of humans -- probably
for a lack of space. However, being so close to a stork in the
morning of Day 2, was special even by Dutch standards.

Timea designed today's route to cover two national parks, the
Lauwersmeer (rated the number 3 most beautiful place in the
Netherlands by a 2004 Dutch TV series), and the Alde Feanen.

> We saw many of the famous "wild" Friesian horses along the way. (An
  American Mustang would probably laugh at the definition of "wild"
  here, but so be it.)

I later read in a brochure about the region that this is quite rare --
but then we saw so many of them, that this is hard to believe. As
Timea remarked, the brochure probably wants you to feel special. The
brochure also educated me about the purpose of the horses:
Similar to the cows in other parts of the Netherlands, they are to
keep the vegetation shallow and to avoid forestation. Why exactly that
is not wanted, I have not figured out, but I assume it has to do with
keeping the land in its more or less maritime form. The lack of trees
(or anything, really) also meant that Timea did not like the landscape
much, but for me, just riding my bike was enough.

Our routing also meant that we had to take two ferries. Komoot nicely
announced these, and I really liked them. Both ferries were
solar-powered and basically inaudible. The limit of 12 persons aboard
was strict (one could have easily crammed 20+ aboard in different
countries) -- which means, given a round-trip takes the ferries 25
minutes, you have to calculate a significant waiting time and factor
in that you might not make it on the first ferry that arrives.

The first lake crossing near Terherne had an interesting line-up
system, in which you would take one of 12 wooden sticks to reserve
your spot (you could also possibly use it to fight other passengers)
-- the second relied on a friendly fellow passenger, who announced
that we were number 15 and 16 in line (and thus had to wait for the
next boat). After the boats, the route had some gravel parts. Komoot
would normally not allow you to take race bikes on those -- but we
figured, since it was only 4km in total, it would be fine (and so it
was).

Combined with a slow start and some indecisiveness about where to have
breakfast, the result of this was that by 3 PM we had only gone 30km.
Day 2 was also a more or less constant battle with number 4 winds from
the North East. Especially the last 30km were a bit taxing with a
direct headwind. We were very glad when we arrived at our hotel for
the night in the beautiful village of Winsum. 

Tot Day 3, in which we literally go over water (even more!),
