**As I set down in the Intercity to Tilburg, it came to me how bizarre
  a thing it is that I am doing: I pay quite some money (10,26€ for
  the ride plus 6,90€ for the bike) to get from A to B, only to then
  ride back to A.**

After indulging on the thought for some time (and the realization that
so much of what we as humans do is in some sense pointless -- why
would a two- or three-day trip, with much higher associated overall
costs due to lodging, somehow be better?), I decided not to get too
philosophical and rather tackle the job at hand: get from Tilburg,
which I know fairly well because my friend Dino from Munich used to do
his Ph.D. there, to Den Haag. I stepped outside Tilburg Train Station,
got my stuff together, and edited my route on my mobile a little bit:
I wanted to go via Breda. Turned on the Bolt, and voila, off I was
within 2 minutes.

  out and do what we have to do.

The route Komoot chose was not too spectacular this time, with some
pretty long sections along highways. One section was particularly
funny, as I rode on a road (no bike path available) where a big
construction was going on. The road about 4km long and straight, and I
got overtaken by some construction vehicles. But their Δ<sub>v</sub>
was so small that I could still see them after 5min. Around 65 km in,
the bike path was blocked and that is when I had a bit of a weak
moment.

> When I am out hiking, I barely ever seem to eat any of the Musli
bars I pack -- with biking, it is totally different. Even though I
would wager that the effort intensity is comparable. Maybe I am wrong
there.

This is when I unpacked the [Clif
Bloks](http://www.clifbar.nl/products/clif-shot-bloks) Nora and Ryan
had brought me from the US. (FWIW, this is also the first food item I
actually ate while riding Aero.) As the name implies, the bar comes in
a couple of conveniently-sized blocks that have a consistency somewhere
between really fresh gummi bears and a gel. In addition to being full
of glucose, they also contain caffeine. I ate 5 of them over the
course of the next hour, which is -- as I later found out -- the
caffeine equivalent of about 2 coffees.

And this is when I started putting the hammer down. I even had saddle
pain before eating, but after those magic blocks, it was all gone!
Moreover, the weather got more and more gnarly, so I had
extra-motivation to come home early.

I also filled a bottle with [Hammer Nutrition Perpetuem Extreme
Endurance](https://www.amazon.com/Hammer-Nutrition-Perpetuem-Endurance-Chocolate/dp/B01BH9DS2Y),
which I drank throughout the ride, but was not as impressed by the
drink as its name: I did not like the taste nor could I feel any
effects.

![Hearte Rate plot.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/heartrate_tilburg.png)

One can observe a few things from the heart rate plot above: 1) The
stop around 65 km (big arrow) was not my first stop. The ones before
that were much shorter, and mainly to take nice pictures for the
blog. Every time, though, you see that my heart rate significantly
decreases. This is a good sign. 2) Once I ate the blocks, I was all of
a sudden able to put my heart rate at a much higher steady level than
before -- I was just thrashing it, basically (or so I felt).

A scary situation was a scooter in Rotterdam who took a wide turn and
ended up on my side of the bike path, slowly going toward me as I
approached with ~30km/h. I shouted at the guy while braking. Since it
was wet and I have carbon wheels, the rim brakes didn't immediately
bite -- it takes a second or so for the water to rub off and friction
to do its work. Meanwhile, the scooter guy was standing still mid-way
on the bike path. As I went around him he said something to the effect
of whether I was "gek" (crazy). This got me thinking, because usually
*I* would say that most of the scooter boys are crazy. I have since
reflected a bit on the situation: I did not do anything wrong, he was
on the wrong side, not doing a good turn, and then ending up not
reacting at all. But eventually, "being right" does not help me much.
I should factor in everything that can go wrong. And, with these
scooters (and the usual clientele riding them), there is quite
something that can. There are enough situations where I can put the
power down safely.

![Pretty dirty]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/dirtybike.jpg)

While thrashing it, I did one of the few "climbs" in the Netherlands
-- for that, you usually either have to be in a hilly area (usually
close to the Belgian border) or, like in this case, go up a bridge. As
I was riding around the corner for the 1:30-minute climb (?), I saw
another racebiker struggle up it. He seemed to have a pretty nice
bike, but I noticed I was closing the gap quickly. I did a set cadence
climb -- try and turn the pedals at a given frequency, with possibly
varying power output depending on the gradient of the climb.

The biker in front of me was visibly putting serious power into his
pedals, but he was just smashing them and going all over the place
with much too low a cadence -- no good form at all. Of course, that
person might have (and probably has!) done 200km already that day, but
in that moment of overtaking him, all of that did not matter to
me. While giving him [the look ;-) (not
really),](https://youtu.be/F94TCxLYZew?t=113) I even noticed that he
had a set of aero bars. 30 seconds later, I saw the guy in an aero
tuck going down the bridge ... oh well.

Tot zo,

Length: 102 km
Average speed: 26.0 km/h

Weather: 14°C Overcast. SE Wind: 13 km/h. It started to
dribble and then got wetter and wetter. Riding through
the rain was surprisingly okay, though.

Route rating: 3/5. This route was ok. Not sure whether
there are any other sensible paths from start to finish.

Clothing: Skins, cycling jersey, legwarmers. Blue hoodie,
which I got rid of after 20km.

Feeling: 3/5. I felt a bit sick when starting, but
fantastic in the end!
