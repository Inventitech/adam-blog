**In Seattle there are more dogs than kids.** 

We heard at very beginning we arrived here. Apparently this statement has so many angles one would not believe. I have seen some high rise apartment buildings advertising themselves to be “pet friendly”. The apartment I have found is one of them. Friendly as it sounds they do not mention the continuous barking you hear during the night, they stay silent about the dog pee smell sometimes appearing in the elevator or some random parts of the building. Let alone the continuous pee smell on the rooftop as due to lack of parks in the city center dogs are taken for a pee walk there. This is so disgusting!!
You would ask what the dogs are doing while their owner works the whole day. Well the city developed a whole industry for this. You see Dog Hotels or Day Cares, our building has one of them. Every morning the place gets jammed with dogs.

Of course they take the dogs for hiking too! Let alone having a leasure walk in the parks or forest, NO, they are taking them for rock climbing too. They are pushing the dogs through their laces to jump from cliff too cliff.

Isn’t this cruel? Well, seems like there is a compensation mechanism. By walking on the street I have seen this restaurant chain. Apparently they are serving food only for dogs!

And if all this would not be enough, when I see this Dog Ice cream advertisement on the ice cream shop I am absolutely convinced that this is insane!

Is this really what people call animal friendly??

Otherwise Week 5 passed really quickly. Moritz was away on a business trip for 2 days, I kept exploring the greener parts of the city with more or less success.

I spent some time figuring out how the healthcare system works here so that I could visite the dentistry and the optometrist. 

As Saturday was rainy we dedicated Sunday for our outdoor adventure. We did a daytrip to Lake Serene and the Bridal Falls.

We finished the hike at 20:00. Normally the drive back home should take 1 hour and 10 minutes, not on a Sunday evening though. There was a huge line of cars waiting to return to the city. It took 3 hours this time for us. In the same time it was a good opportunity for me to practice drinving. The wonderful sunset on the road was our compensation for the long waiting in the car.
