**Today, I started the day with a Yoga session together with Timea, who
is an absolutely awesome Yogi. I have previously done Yoga (a.o. with
[Thomas](https://twitter.com/nihathrael) and
[Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene)), but having
someone who is sooo good at it correct you (if you are as inflexible
as me), is really invaluable. I will make Yoga workouts and stretches
a routine. Race biking puts you in some fairly unnatural and, frankly,
uncomfortable positions (head forward).**

Then, I realized I really need a bike computer. So far I have been
using my mobile as a replacement bike computer. This worked pretty
okay, as my mobile actually turns out to have pretty awesome battery
usage (constant screen-on time with GPPS tracking and navigation of >
4 hours).

However, it has disadvantages, too: Yesterday, I spent one hour trying
to pair my sensors (I have a breast strep to measure heart rate as a
loaner from [Georgios](http://gousios.gr/) and a Giant Speed/Cadence
sensor that comes as standard with the Giant Pro frames). Over the
last year, I occassionally had the combination working. But it was
extremely flaky. Sometimes the sensors would pair and sometimes they
wouldn't. Then, my mobile is pretty big. For example, that means I
can't actually fit the mobile and my aero bars together. In addition,
I don't really want my mobile to get wet when it rains (although,
supposedly, it should do just fine).

So I did a bit of research and pretty quickly knew that the computer I
wanted was an Elemnt Bolt. There was a Chinese computer that seemed
pretty interesting (and almost capable of everything the Bolt can do,
including navigation), but coming at 130€ I thought I'd rather spend
the extra money on something that works for sure where one has good
support -- Wahoo are apparently excellent in pushing updates. So I
rode to [Correct in Rotterdam](https://www.correct.nl/) to get the
[cheapest Elemnt Bolt in the
Netherlands.](https://www.correct.nl/artikel/Wahoo-ELEMNT+Bolt-art569117.php)
Unfortunately, they knew that, too, so my pathetic haggling attempts
were ill-fated.

I really liked the Correct shop, actually. People were friendly as I
entered with my race bike (I was previously sent out of a McDonald's
and told to leave my bike, seriously!?). Down in the basement, they
have a nice bike/sports shop with an almost complete Park Tool wall
that reminded me so much of the [GCN Tech Show
wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEWi8ZKFEE&t=349s). I
especially liked that you are free to explore it on your own without
someone watching over your shoulder (that reminds me of my experience
in a mall in India, where I basically had an entourage of 3 employees
follow me, despite telling them that I justed wanted look around. I
mean, I get they are well-intentioned, but I just can't think and
inspect stuff properly with some stranger awkwardly hanging 3 feet to
the left and back of me).

> Just last week, Correct were selling the Bolt for 200€ and this
week, they already increased the price to 225€. Darn. Well, that's
still 25€ cheaper than anywhere else.

![At the windy junction.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/peestop.jpg)

As you can see on my ride, I unfortunately overshot Correct by some 5
km. The moment I realized this was pretty bitter, and it would have
implications for later.

Before that, Komoot took me on some really nice bike paths to the
north of Delft, which I did not know, despite having lived and cycled
in Delft for more than 5 years. Well done! Then, through an
industrial zone in Rotterdam and by the Schiedam sauna. I had not
looked at this part of the route too carefully in advance, so I did
not know I was gonna pass by. It's funny how when you have been to an
area a couple of times you develop some sense of feeling for it.

Along the Maas, the wind started to bother me. As I turned north along
the coast, I had an almost full-on headwind so I had to push even
harder to get the bike forward at all -- at least that's apparently
what it feels when your speed drops from 30km/h to 18km/h.

> I was actually surprised to see I was still doing 18km/h. Good that
I logged. While riding, it felt more like 12.

There is a reason why they call it the "Dutch mountain". With my legs
pretty empty and all energy bars gone, I resorted to the (one and)
last banana. It restored my senses enough to turn away a bit from the
super-nice bike path along the coast onto some more shelter roads. It
was still some way from home (my mobile's battery ran out beforehand,
so I chose to rather stop and save the track prematurely than
potentially loose it all), where I arrived pretty exhausted but to the
delicious smell of dinner prepared by Timea.

So long,

Length: 88 km
Average speed: 22.0 km/h
Intensity: 95%

Weather: 9°C (at 17:00), NE Wind: 22 km/h (felt like more
than that!?), very soft hail and a bit of rain

Route rating: 3/5. Pretty nice parts to Rotterdam, a bit
high-way like in Rotterdam, and then nice parts along the
coast. Dominant wind direction does not favor this
direction of the route most of the year, though.

Clothing: Perfect (Skins underwear, Bike trikot, green soft
shell, legwarmers), overshoes. Added the wind jacket on the
way home.

Feeling: 4/5. Holy crap! I am doing this now!
