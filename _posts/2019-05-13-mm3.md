**After we successfully completed the Amstel Gold Race [yesterday](/mm2),
  on the last MMday we took it a bit more relaxed. We went for a 90k
  spin that Martin designed on the breakfast table. The idea was to
  explore yet more of our surroundings, this time to the North (after
  going [east](/mm1) and [west](/mm2) on the previous MMdays), which
  included a visit to the only national park in Belgium, the NP Hoge
  Kempen, and to divide the route about equally on Dutch as well as
  Belgian ground (with lunch in Belgium, preferably).**

Subsequently, we stopped quite a bit along the way and really inhaled
the fresh air along the beautiful route. Which is ironic, because I
assume it did not always use to be that peaceful and refreshing: we
passed quite a few mines, relics from a time when coal was exploited
from the ground in this region (similar to the not-so-distant
Rurgebiet in Germany). We also enjoyed the sunny, if only a bit cold,
weather (with a coffee stop, of course).

For lunch, we had (again!) burger with fries. Finding the place, which
was rated with 4.5 on Google (and worth every star!) turned out to be
a bigger navigational feat, as its small street was quite well
hidden. Once arrived, Martin wanted the big fries portion, which the
owner warned him would be "very big indeed". Hah, I couldn't even
finish my small portion!

On the way back, on the Dutch side, we found some really nice asphalt
cycle paths that just screamed "high speed". This was on and along
dikes close to the river Maas, that gives Maastricht its name. Martin
and I went into a good rotation scheme and were soon overtaking other
bikers (obviously, if you are doing 35km/h).

This is what it looks like when you pack two racebikes along with
equipment into a 1-series BMW: It just about fi(e)ts! I am a bit sad
the MMdays are over, but there is more to come!

Tot zo,
