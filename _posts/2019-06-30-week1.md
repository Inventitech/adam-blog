**Moving and moving again** 
Saturday morning was moving act #2. As we like variety we have selected another place to stay for the following couple of days. This time it was a hotel next to the office of Moritz.

For the weekend the original plan was to leave the city as early as possible. 
However we have encountered some difficulty renting a car for Saturday - the rental place run out of cars. Too bad. 



**Cycling in the city is surprisingly not impossible!**
As impromptu plan B we have then rented the Lime electric city bikes. There are two companies offering electric bike services in Seattle. The city is full of more or less ignorantly parked red and yellow-green bikes. The rental process is smooth, the driving experience is less soo - this was the first time ever I felt scared when driving a bike!!! The geometry of the bike is weird -the least to say - and the electric engine feels very far from natural. No suprise some people are trowing these bikes to the ocean.

We rode our new veicles for 80 minutes to reach the Discovery park. The beauty of the park did not outweigh the loss of 40 dollars which we paid for the bike rentals. On the way back we took public buses.

The park was suprisingly satisfactory as opposed to the fact that it is very close to the city center.


Sunday noon our rental car was waiting for us in the so we had the morning to explore the excitement the Pride Parade brought to the Seattle downtown.

In the afternoon then we hiked Mt Washington. Visiting the state of Washington one would expect to meet the most 
majestic peak being called Washington. One most not expect too much though. Overall it was a great first encounter with the American nature and it was a good warmup for future adventures with a moderate 900 meter elevation. 
From the top we had a view to the autostrada where we started and some surrounding lakes of the Olialli national park.

This was by far the most exhaustive and stressful week I could imagine!
