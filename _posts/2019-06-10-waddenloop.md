**Yesterday night, we slept in the town of Pieterburen. As it turns
  out (I had little time to plan ahead since we booked the
  accommodation that same day), this is a center for Waddenlopen, mud
  walking across the land when the sea recedes during ebb. Having done
  this as a child, I was super-excited about it and tried to convince
  Timea to participate.**

This kinda worked and so we set out with a pretty big group on the
sea. I absolutely loved it (Timea not so much) and enjoyed the care
and information our [guides from Dijkstra](http://wadloop.nl/) gave. I
think every one else seemed to like it, too. But going where is
normally the sea, can be quite dangerous so I absolutely recommend
getting a guide. What amazed me was the difference to when we were
riding three meters next to the sea yesterday, now that sea had
completely receeded and was ready for us to walk on. Timea's stance on
the Waddenzee loop was something along these lines:

> In Hungary, we also have mud and people usually try to avoid
  it. Here, people get all excited about paying for it!

Well, fair enough ... here is how much fun I had:

Back on the bike, the national park "Drentsche Aa" was another
highlight: There is an asphalt cycle path that leads right through the
heart of this pretty spectacular, yet small, nature reserve. I also
appreciated the hand-operated ferry that brings you over the river
before it.

I guess the mud walk (or the hour-long discussions leading up to it
...) must have been very taxing on us because the bikes did not really
roll and I hardly remember when cycling 73km felt that tough. I was
super hungry at the end of it (and actually for some time in the days
to come).

On the train to Den Haag, we went through quite some rain, of which we
had none while we were on the bikes during this nice 2-day
outing. Again, perfect planning that the outsiders might consider
sheer luck ;).

Tot zo,
