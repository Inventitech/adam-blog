**Summer weather as I returned from Montreal at 7:30 in
  Schiphol. Unfortunately, I was so tired that I fell asleep and only
  got out cycling at 6 PM. I could have done a really long ride
  instead.**

Also, I could not find my Wahoo Elemnt Bolt! Damn, did I leave it in
Schweinfurt or had I lost it somewhere!? So that really downed my
motivation. Eventually, I managed to drag myself out to go for a spin
to Hoek van Holland (HvH) and back. Going through Den Haag on this
Sunday felt as if the city had been desserted, because everybody (and
their dog) were at the beach. 

> I could see my legs turn the peddles, but until mid-ride, I never
  really felt in-control.

In HvH, I ingested an energy gel (pretty delicious!) and started to
put the power down a bit on the nice wide bike paths. You can see the
result of my efforts in the graph above. During ICSE, I had a
discussion about a time trial I wanted to participate in and the
insanely fast times the participants had with [Jon
Bell](https://www.jonbell.net/), in which he claimed to easily do
30mph for 22km and "I don't even train". Well, Jon, I did 23mph here
for 12km (riding much of it on the Aero bars), and I'm actually pretty
happy with it.

Tot zo,
