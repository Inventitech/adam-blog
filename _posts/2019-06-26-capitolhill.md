**Seattle consist of 127 districts neigborhoods. Today I picked Capitol Hill to visit.**

There were some housing options available in the Capitol Hill area. On the map that area seemed a bit distant from the Office, but I was curious to see how the vibes of that neighborhood is. After a relatively short walk I have arrived to a rather silent and green area. 

My biggest challenge was how to find my walk way through the autostrada which has separated the two parts of the city.

On my way I crossed by a huge Stabucks roastery. It was back in 1971 when Starbucks has opened its first coffee shop. The shop was located at the Pike Place Market. The day before I passed by that shop too, however not too remarkable I recall no other other than a huge row of aisan turists. The Roastery itself is huge spacious. Trying coffee there is still on my list.
