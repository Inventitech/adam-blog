**The weather prediction for today was so-lala, with lots of
  intermediate rain showers. Moreover, I had just recently finished
  repairing my tire, so I did not want to go too far from home just
  yet.**

So I thought what better way to use the time than with some
high-intensity interval training? I have never done HIT on a bike
before, did not read into "how to do it before" so I just figured, 5
times á 3 minutes should do fine. I did intermittent rest periods of 5
minutes between the high-intensity efforts.

I wonder what other people think about you when you come blazing from
behind, overtaking them, and then four minutes later, they overtake
you again (there was one rider who was overtaking me just as my next
interval started -- if you read this: sorry, I did not mean to
outsprint you).

I am a bit surprised my heart rate did not go over 176bpm, as I was
pretty gassed at the end. I am pretty sure it can go higher than that
(and the formula 220 - age suggests that, too). Something to
investigate for the future.

In the evening, we went running. I could definitely feel I had already
done something that day and that my legs were pretty empty. Good to
know that even with only an hour available, one can definitely set a
training impulse.
