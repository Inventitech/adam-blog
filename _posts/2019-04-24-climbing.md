**After a long climbing hiatus, I went on to go climbing again
  today.**

> Starting climbing again after some time is always frustrating to me
  -- you see what you used to be able to do, but just can't do it
  anymore.

Either way, it was good to catch up with
[Petra](https://twitter.com/petraschoof) again.

Before that, when I inspected Aero, I saw that it *had
punctured*. Probably while cleaning it, I removed a glass shard from
the tire and it opened up a hole. Kind of ironic (and good luck) that
this happened at home and not somewhere on the road. Unfortunately,
the tire milk could not seal it, so it left me with a big mess in the
room.

Not wanting to replace the relatively new tire, I then patched it up
from the inside with a regular repair kit and got the tire on
air-tight (something I had feared only a few days ago), thanks to help
from [Timea](https://www.instagram.com/szilitimea/). The verdict is
out whether this will have fixed it.

I am not yet ready to give up on these tires, or tubeless. So I will
have to order some tire sealant. Somehow, I really feel the sealant
should have fixed the puncture, even though it was pretty big at about
half a centimeter. You could also see that it was partially working
but then lost air again. I also wonder whether the mixture of the
Schwalbe and the old Giant sealant were not working together so well.

Stay tuned for an upcoming report (hopefully not from the hospital).

Tot zo,
