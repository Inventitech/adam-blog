**While doing a few Yoga excerises on the side throughout the week,
  today Timea and I did another long Yoga session, in which we
  repeated last week's workout.**

> Even though I am still a noob, it was pretty amazing to see how much
  progress I made within just ten days.

As a side-project, I also worked on an [application that fetches all
your Strava
activities](https://github.com/Inventitech/gpx-from-strava) and
generates one convenient KML file. The idea is to then be able to
display them as one map, in e.g., Google Earth. I did this because I
hit some limitations with the otherwise excellent [Strava Multiple
Ride Mapper](https://www.jonathanokeeffe.com/strava/map.php).

This was an interesting experience because I learned a lot about
authentication and pagination in an established ecosystem and GPS
files in general. I found the combination also pretty empowering --
normally, my digital and 'real' life are somewhat less connected.

Tot zo,
