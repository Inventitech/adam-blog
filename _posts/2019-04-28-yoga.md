**While doing a few Yoga excerises on the side throughout the week,
  today Timea and I did another long Yoga session, in which we
  repeated last week's workout.**

> Even though I am still a noob, it was pretty amazing to see how much
  progress I made within just ten days.

As a side-project, I also worked on an application that fetches all
your Strava activities and generates one convenient KML file to
display them in e.g., Google Earth. This was an interesting experience
because I learned a lot about authentication and pagination in an
established ecosystem and GPS files in general. I found the
combination also pretty empowering -- normally, my digital and 'real'
life are somewhat less connected.

So long,
