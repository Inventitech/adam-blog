While waiting for some essential camping equipment to be delivered we decided to do two day hikes this weekend. On Saturday we hit the roads again. This time I was the one to suggest the itinerer. I wish I did not do it. As the road to the Mt Pilchuck trailhead was in very bad condition Moritz was very angry at me of not making a note of alarm on this. Our car was not really fit for the purpose.

With eyes closed I survived the 6 mile car ride. Compared to the ride the hike itself was nothing. Unfortunately the peak was covered in clouds again.

As my wish for sunshine came true on Sunday we have targeted the beautiful Snow Lake.

Initially we planned a 24 km hike, but both of us was not in the best mood so we completed only 22 km. This area also belongs to the Alpine Lake Wilderness area -we visited the weekend before. So far this was the most beautiful scenery I have seen in the Americas.
