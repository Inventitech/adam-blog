**Yes we learned that when you apply for a visa no smiling picture shall be presented.**

The taxi arrived at 5:55 in the morning to transport us to the airport. The taxi driver was a bit upset looking at our baggage. Somehow he managed to push all our 8 luggages into his Tesla. 
With the stopover in Frankfurt airport the overall flight took around 14 hours. The continuous humming noise on the airplane caused me headache. There was a traffic jam at the airport so the border control took overall 3 hours. By the time we arrived to the Airbnb all I wanted is to put my head on a cushion and sleep. Poor Moritz had another flight to San Francisco where his bootcamp started. I wouldn’t be able to travel more that day.

For the first 7 days we booked a not to great apartment on Airbnb as I would have liked to explore the neighborhood and make a better decision regarding the permanent housing option. However we had a cool view from the rooftop.

Seattle the home of the Space needle, Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks is going to be our home for the next couple of months.
