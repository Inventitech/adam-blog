**For today, before I leave for the U.S., Nora and Erna had announced
  their arrival in Den Haag. The weather was again quite okay (even
  sunny in the beginning), so some riding needed to be done. I left a
  little later than planned, but really wanted to get the originally
  planned ride in.**

The wise thing to do would have been to shorten the ride. This way, I
had an ambitious goal, though: Arrive with Nora and Erna back to the
flat in Den Haag. Erna had shared their live location on WhatsApp as
they were driving from Germany to The Netherlands, so I could always
see how I was doing, relatively.

Well, unfortunately, I missed the synchronous arrival target by a good
30 minutes (thanks to Timi for opening the door in Den Haag!).

> I did have good reason to push. On the flip side, that meant I did
  not even have the time time to take a picture of today's ride.

And, boy, did the pedals turn! My only regret would perhaps have been
the direction of travel -- on the last 30km leg alongside the highway,
I had a pretty strong headwind. I am sure that cost me a lot of time
overall.

Still, it felt really nice to push hard for once! 

Tot zo,

(There was Day 65, a [64km recovery ride with
Timea](https://www.strava.com/activities/2450073469), during which we
visited the Zaanse Schans, in between, for which I did not write a
blog post.)
