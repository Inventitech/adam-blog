**Today I wondered how many of my blog posts begin with the word
  today: Only 4 it seems. So that's cool. Apart from that, I met
  Jorrin at [Lola](/lola/) to talk bikes, plan our 3-day trip during
  which we want to cycle to Delftzijl ("from Delft to Delftzijl") near
  the German border, and, finally, go for a ride.**

That ride turned into an 80km spin alongside the coast, all the way up
to Zandvoort, the
[former](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Zandvoort) and
[probably
future](https://www.autobahn.eu/12951/formule-1-in-2020-op-zandvoort-gp-van-nederland-definitief/)
F1 grandprix circus (which is a bit crazy to think about, just because
it is really, really small). Despite the weather (I did not get too
lucky with it so far, I remember last spring to have been much nicer),
I really enjoyed it and Jorrin's company.

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of wearing long trousers underneath
my cycling shorts, which looks cool, but also caused some unnecessary
scuffing and pain toward the end of the ride. And I also disconnceted
the heart rate strap while in the cafe (to save battery) and then
couldn't get it on while riding. Don't do this again.

Tot zo,
