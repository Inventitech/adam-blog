**For Timea's birthday (and Easter), the weather turned out just as
  ordered: three beautiful days full of sunshine here in the
  The Netherlands. As Timea and I had some [empty spots on our cycling
  map](/starting) in the north, Timea designed an exceptionally nice
  3-day tour through the Northern Netherlands -- that means through
  the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen in particular.**

Today, we decided to take it a bit easier on the bike and make use of
the kayaking opportunity right in front of the hotel. We took a tandem
kayak and paddled to the next village, which turned out to be a 13km
round-trip. On the way there, we had a strong headwind. It never
ceases to amaze me how when you are using smaller muscle groups --
like the deltoideus in this case -- you feel good one moment and then,
only a couple minutes later, are almost completely fatigued. Anyway,
with a tailwind on the way back, we made it back no problem. Also a
big thank you to the nice people in the motorboat who put a huge bow
wave into our kayak by driving in the middle of the channel!

The afternoon saw us go to Groningen (by bike). Despite the pretty
strong headwind (again!), I really liked the landscape. The little
channels in Groningen seem to have less clear borders than elsewhere
and are meandering around quite a bit more. Moreover, the bike paths
do not tend to go straight for miles on end, instead, they take
relatively frequent turns. I only had the feeling that they could have
maybe made the concrete bike paths, which often nicely ran over dams,
5cm wider. Granted, this way, you had a bit of an adrenaline rush
every time someone would come your way.

Mandatorily, the riding finished (as it did last year) with an ice
cream in Kampen. The ice cream is actually not as good as at De Lellie
in Delft or Luciano in Den Haag, but it is all you can get
there. Already looking forward to next year's edition of the trip,
which will feature as "Tour de Pixus".

Tot zo,

If you find the GPS track a bit funky: Note that due to the track
closure by NS, we had to bridge the gap in train service again.
