**For Timea's birthday (and Easter), the weather turned out just as
  ordered: three beautiful days full of sunshine here in the
  Netherlands. As Timea and I had some [empty spots on our cycling
  map]() in the north, Timea designed an exceptionally nice 3-day tour
  through the Northern Netherlands -- that means through the Dutch
  provinces of Friesland and Groningen in particular.**

Of course, with any trip you undertake with the train there are always
surprises -- the first one on this trip was that we could not actually
reach Zwolle due to some track works. The Dutch railway company
usually organizes replacement buses in such a situation, but if you
are by bike, you are out of luck.

> NS (Dutch railway company) lets you take your bike on the train, but
  in case of rail closures you cannot take the bike on the bus -- that
  seems like a big oversight.

So Timea did a bit of last-minute re-routing and our new route took us
from Kampen Zuid (where the train service stopped) to Lemmer (our
first overnight stay), throguh the provinces of Overijssel and
Flevoland. This being a multi-day trip, I did not take Aero, but
instead the trustee commuter bike Kona. I fitted it with two
penier-style bags that had all our luggage for the
trip. Unfortunately, I forgot to weigh the combination at the end, but
I suspect a total of around 20kg.

To navigate, I fitted the Wahoo Elemnt on Kona, which worked
beautifully again. I was also quite curious how much effort I have to
spend on bike trips with Timea -- from my gut feeling, the base effort
is usually relatively low, but somehow, at the end of the day, I am
always quite tired. So I again packed Georgios's heart rate strap.

Its results indeed confirmed what I was sensing: My average heart rate
was very low at 109, with a maximum of 143, towards the last
kilometers when we picked up the pace. Total kalories consumed were
827 (although I think this is on the low side for a full day
outdoors). Compare this to [my ride from Tilburg](), where I burned
3,076 kalories and had an average heart rate of 145, for pretty much
the same distance.

We saw lots of tulips on the way, which was important for Timea. For
me, riding in Flevoland has its cons: In many areas, you have to ride
on the road, which is barely wide enough for two cars to pass each
other when they use the roghed-up side track patch of pavement on both
sides. Moreover, I have the feeling that cars tend to speed there
quite a bit.


Tot morgen, day number 2, in which we take two ferries!

Length: 102 km
Average speed: 26.0 km/h

Weather: 14Â°C Overcast. SE Wind: 13 km/h. It started to
dribble and then got wetter and wetter. Riding through
the rain was surprisingly okay, though.

Route rating: 3/5. This route was ok. Not sure whether
there are any other sensible paths from start to finish.

Clothing: Skins, cycling jersey, legwarmers. Blue hoodie,
which I got rid of after 20km.

Feeling: 3/5. I felt a bit sick when starting, but
fantastic in the end!
