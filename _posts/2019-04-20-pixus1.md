**For Timea's birthday (and Easter), the weather turned out just as
  ordered: three beautiful days full of sunshine here in the
  Netherlands. As Timea and I had some [empty spots on our cycling
  map](/starting) in the north, Timea designed an exceptionally nice
  3-day tour through the Northern Netherlands -- that means through
  the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen in particular.**

Of course, with any trip you undertake with the train there are always
surprises -- the first one on this trip was that we could not actually
reach Zwolle due to some track works. The Dutch railway company
usually organizes replacement buses in such a situation, but if you
are by bike, you are out of luck.

> [NS (Dutch railway company)](https://www.ns.nl/) lets you take your
  bike on the train, but in case of rail closures you cannot take the
  bike on the bus -- that seems like a big oversight.

So Timea did a bit of last-minute re-routing and our new route took us
from Kampen Zuid (where the train service stopped) to Lemmer (our
first overnight stay), throguh the provinces of Overijssel and
Flevoland. This being a multi-day trip, I did not take Aero, but
instead the trustee commuter bike Kona. I fitted it with two
penier-style bags that had all our luggage for the
trip. Unfortunately, I forgot to weigh the combination at the end, but
I suspect a total of around 20kg.

To navigate, I fitted the Wahoo Elemnt on Kona, which worked
beautifully again. I was also quite curious how much effort I have to
spend on bike trips with Timea -- from my gut feeling, the base effort
is usually relatively low, but somehow, at the end of the day, I am
always quite tired. So I again packed Georgios's heart rate strap.

Its results indeed confirmed what I was sensing: My average heart rate
was very low at 109, with a maximum of 143, towards the last
kilometers when we picked up the pace. Total kalories consumed were
827 (although I think this is on the low side for a full day
outdoors). Compare this to [my ride from Tilburg](/tilburg), where I burned
3,076 kalories and had an average heart rate of 145, for pretty much
the same distance.

 Timea)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/pday1_tulipfield.jpg)

For me, riding in Flevoland has its cons: In many areas, you have to
ride on the road, which is barely wide enough for two cars to pass
each other when they use the roghed-up side track patch of pavement on
both sides. Moreover, I have the feeling that cars tend to speed there
quite a bit.

A three-day bike trip with overnight stays in hotel, how do you do
that, I hear you ask? Well, I usually take one of everything: A set of
nice-ish cloths with long but light-weight trousers to wear in the
evening in the hotel, and exactly one set of cycling clothes that I
wash in the evening. Being fast-dry stuff, it is usually good to go in
the morning. If not, the hair dryer helps. If there is no hair dryer
and it is still a bit damp: oh well, there are worse things ...

This time, we did not even make an effort to save weight, but I think
we could have easily compressed our set of clothes down to fit a race
bike saddle bag. Maybe this comes from my mountainieering experience,
but I tend to find that many bike packers carry around a lot more
things than they really need, severely limiting their range and fun on
the bike. One more thing to post about in the future ..

Tot morgen, day number 2, in which we take two ferries!
