**This ride started with an unusual sight in the Netherlands: An
  uninterrupted, two-kilometer uphill section. I was quite
  delighted. This was also the first time I did anything that can be
  considered a "climb" with Aero. (I now see on Strava that the
  average percentage of that climb was 2% ramping up to 5%m for a
  total elevation gain of 34m, lol.)**

While I did not run out of gears of course, I am not so sure I can
realistically ride up some of the steeper ramps in Belgium that I had
maybe planned to tackle (up to 20%, on cobbles!) with my current bike
setup. My lowest gear is a 36-28, which means that I can still go
round about 10km/h without grinding super-hard. In a few days, I will
ride parts of the Amstel Gold race route together with
[Martin](https://twitter.com/MJWaltl) and I don't plan on making any
changes to the gearing until then. Oh well.

About 15km into my ride, another rider blew past me. The speed
difference was so big that I didn't even consider upping the
pace. From what I could see, he was riding a Giant Propel, too, in
rainbow colors. That's a custom built and very special.

I was now getting hungry and saw a Pannekoekenhuis next to a
roundabout. The place was pretty big but looked nice enough so I
stopped to pull up its Google Rating.

> 3.9 out of 5 on Google Reviews. Normally, I wouldn't consider even
  consider this.

Somehow though, I started reading the reviews and it seemed that most
criticism had to do with service when the place is crowded. Nice when
you can visit it on a Tuesday, so I gave it a try. It wasn't the
cheapest of places (15â‚¬ for the pancake I ordered), but then again the
portion was huge and delicious. In hindsight, going for the vegetarian
pancake with loads of cheese on (and in) it wasn't the easiest on my
stomach. Still, it tasted exquisite and I didn't have any problems
afterward. As a bonus, the coke I ordered came in a ~330ml glass, not
the usual super-mini 230ml that one gets in the Netherlands (hail to
Bavaria, where standard drink size is 500ml, for anything really). The
experience got me thinking, though: What are the implications of
mediocre ratings to restaurants? Why would you ever go to a place with
a low rating?

What followed was an overall really nice ride, with some nice roads
and good scenery. The Netherlands isn't entirely full of channels,
just as typical in this part of the country is heath (as shown on the
picture above, heath on the left, a road with an alley in the middle
and a "bos", forest, to the right). The route also had me see my first
visit to Utrecht. I had the feeling that people were pushing their
bikes much harder than elsewhere in the Netherlands (or maybe I was
just tired?).

In the last 15km, I followed the "autobahn" track into Den Haag. The
bike path is literally next to a very big highway (at least three lanes
in each direction) and there was lots of traffic coming out of Den
Haag. No wonder, it was also around office closing
time. Unfortunately, I also got overtaken by two riders!

> Even with 115km in the legs, I just couldn't let the guys ride away.

While the first one was on a huge touring bike with a tri-steerer
(what a machine!), the second one, drafting, had a pretty old race
bike. Once I had collected myself, I was able to up the pace enough to
sort of stabilize the distance to them. Then, as the pacemaker and his
companion separated, I slowly crept up on the old race bike (with a
youngish rider though!). Just before the section near the highway
ended, I managed to overtake. Chaka. This is kind of ridiculous of
course (for a number of reasons), but one certainly is that I probably
have a 50 or so Watt advantage on my bike.

> Since I [forgot to replace the battery](/intervals2/), unfortunately
  no RPM data today :(. I also noted how the speed data simply based
  on GPS was pretty jumpy and not as smooth as with the sensor.


Tot zo,
