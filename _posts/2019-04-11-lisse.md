**I am running my road bike tubeless. (For the non-cyclists: that
means that I don't have inner tubes. Instead, there is a milky
solution that is supposed to close smaller gaps in the outer tyre
should run through some debris on the road, such as glass or other
objects.) An implication of that is that the milk in the tire ages --
and supposedly dries. Thus, you are no longer protected from
punctures. With the idea to ride a lot in the next two months, I
thought, 10 months after initially filling my bike with the liquid,
it'd be quite good to give it a refill.**

Now, there isn't really a lot of adivce on maintaining your tubeless
setup -- most articles and videos (of which there are plenty) just
talk about how to install in the first place. I did not really want to
do a big operation out of it -- that would mean removing the tire
en*tire*ly, cleaning all left-over fluid from the inside, reseating
the tire and then filling it up with new milk. Especially the idea of
reseating my tires gave me horros. That means to put it on airtight.

Sometimes a regular bike pump is not enough for that and you need a
compressor. Which I don't have. The idea of being unable to ride (or
awkwardly going to petrol stations to try and get a lot of air in the
tire very quickly, which makes it pop and then seal, if one is lucky)
did not sound particularly attractive at just the beginning of my
project. So I simply topped-of whatever milk might (or might not)
still be in the tire. Obviously, the milk in my front tire had not
dried yet and came out in fountains when I did that.

> Pro-tip: For the rear tire, I was already a bit more clever by
putting the valve in the 45° position while doing the operation. Then
the milk follows -- through the magic of gravity -- to the bottom of
the tire and accumulates there instead of squashing in your face if
you leave the valve dead center over the accumulation point.

But let's rewind a bit: Before I could do this, I was missing two
essential tools: a core valve removal tool and the milk. Moreover,
last week, I had ordered a replacement seatpost from the Giant store
in Lisse (which is of course famous for the tulips and being next to
[Keukenhof](https://keukenhof.nl/en/)) because my bolt had somehow
rounded off. This, obviously, is a design flaw on Giant's end.

> Never have I rounded off a bolt in my
life before, and on this one I even used the torque rench.

Well, guess what, it was exactly the torque rench that rounded it
off. First of all, the position of the bolt makes it almost impossible
to access it in a completely vertical line -- the screw has exactly
the same orientation as the seatpost and thus any tool you stick in it
runs parallel. So there is extremly little space to use anything else
than an allen key. So whenever you want to use a torque rench, you
inevitably end up excerting the force in a somewhat non-vertical way
to accomodate for its head.

To make matters worse, the material of the screw is of a really soft
metal and the incision for the allen key on the bolt is by default
somewhat and not too deep -- great combination for a rounded bolt
head. Now, my old bolt is actually still okay, but I feared that one
day, I would not get a spare part anymore -- of course, being an aero
frame, this part is completley proprietary (even the bolt is very much
non-standard).

So my first tour brought me from Den Haag to the Giant Bike store in
Lisse. Planned it with [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) (of which I
just bought the premium version, since I got an offer for 19,99€
instead of 29,99€). The most expensive app I have (with the exception
of the [Most Expensive Ball
Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jahaa.mostexpensiveballgame)
game, but I got that for free).

> The beginning of the route was extremly nice and I actually did not
know it.

Just had to go in a straight line from the street infront of the
apartment, and soon enough I was outside Den Haag, next to the train
lines in a suburan-park setting. I guess I will be riding on that road
a couple more times. On the way there, I basically only had to break
twice -- once for a group of goose giving no fuck at all that I was
approaching and once for a German couple who together, while
discussing where to go next, completely blocked the two lane (!) bike
path.

I asked them whether I should call the local radio station and give
them a report a blocked cycle path near one of the tulip factories
around Sassenheim. The route then lead me via the city center of
Leiden and the notoriously busy and badly designed bus area there --
not too nice. I had pretty strong headwind on the way there. All in
all, I did the almost 60km in 2:20 riding. It was partly sunny, which
was nice, yet quite cold -- so I rode with my long gloves. In Lisse, I
ate a carrot cake piece that Timi had prepared and then headed back
after a ~40 minute stop (including the visit to the Giant store).

Tomorrow, the plan is to bike to Rotterdam and buy a bike computer
there.

So long,
