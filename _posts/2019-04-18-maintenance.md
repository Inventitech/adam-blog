**After yesterday's ride through the rain, my bike (Aero) was in
  urgent need of a thorough clean.**

Of course, if I was a real pro, someone else would do this work for me
;-)

> I actually like taking care of my bike and doing everything myself.

When you live in an apartment complex without a garden or terras,
cleaning your bike is actually not so easy: Where do you wash the
bike? Where do you get water from? I mean, I am not really willing to
let my bike be in the bike stand while I get something I missed from
upstairs, only to return five minutes later to no-more-bike. Let me
know how you do it if you are in a similar situation!

> Clean-your-bike-as-a-service seems like a lucrative business idea for
  people living in flats in big cities. Does it exist?

So cleaning has to be a pretty well-organized activity. I first took
the bike stand down and all the tools I would need, including two
buckets of hot water (grinning at the thought that that leaves them
susceptible to being stolen, too). Then came the bike. I did this in
the yard of our apartment to be a bit sheltered from peasants on the
street. People looked a bit funny at me, but no one said a word, so I
guess it is fine. I would not know how else to do it, anyway.

The bike is now ready for whatever there is to come -- stay tuned for
the planned Easter trip!

Tot zo,
