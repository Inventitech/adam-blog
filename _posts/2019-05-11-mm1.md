**Today was the start of a three day bike adventure with my old friend
  (old as in: we know each other for a long time, not as in "old."
  What a weird expression!) Martin. Martin got himself a Canyon
  Endurace AL 7.0 Disc last year, which had not seen quite enough
  kilometers yet. So we decided to meet up around the area of
  Maastricht for some awesome touring. Martin went their by train, and
  I picked him up by car in Aachen the day before.**

Our first day adventure saw me touch his bike pretty "good" in a
corner (I steered into the corner, Martin rode on straight), but we
both pressed "hard" into it, and both stayed on the bike no problem,
good!

For most of the day, I had a very annyoing squeak from my bike, which
I assume to come from the saddle pen. Oh boy, I hope placing in the
[new saddle pen](/lisse) will help. Throw back to the very beginning of
my blog: Of course, I tried to get a little more life out of the old
part.

The route, that I designed via Komoot, had us go next, but not
technically through, the ["bike through
water"](https://www.fietsnetwerk.nl/actueel/innovatieve-fietsroute-door-het-water/)
street (my exclamation was similarly loud and entertaining to the
other people who had assembled there). As a side note: I set the
second fastet time of the day there. Not sure whether to be proud of
this performance. We faced some pretty heft headwind along the
channel, but on the way back, the support was oh-so-sweet. Around
midway into our ride, we ate very nice pizza for a late-ish lunch.

> Genereally, we were stunned by the friendliness of the Belgian
motorist (or should I say: Vlandrian?) toward race bikers.

In contrast to the Netherlands, in Belgium, the motorist almost always
has the right of way, but more than 9 out of 10 times, people would
stop for us and wave us over. So friendly! Quality of the cycling
routes was pretty good, if only with more debris than in the
Netherlands, with a very short cobble section that made us both agree
that it was a good idea we did not go for one of the cobbled classics.

Also of note: This was Martin's first race bike tour with more than
100km in the past 10 years -- an event we celebrated duely with one or
two beers on the terrace of our nice camping home.

Tot morgen, when we will attempt a true classic: the tourist version
of the Amstel Gold race.
