**On one of my [first cycling trips,](/ing/) I tracked my ride using
  three different GPS'es: one [generated from my
  mobile](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-a1/), my [Amazfit sports
  watch](https://en.amazfit.com/stratos.html), and my [newly
  bought](/correct/) Wahoo Elemnt Bolt. In this post, I finally get
  around to comparing them.**

To compare them, using Strava does not make sense: Strava takes your
original track and maps them to known roads. Instead, for this
article, I exported the raw GPS data, uploaded them to a GPS
comparison site and imported them in Google Earth.

> I followed [DC Rainmaker's
  advice](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/analyzer) (who actually was in
  Delft on [the
  weekend](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/06/5-random-things-did-this-weekend-94.html))
  to use Satelite and not Map view for comparison of GPS tracks.

I compared two bespoke devices, my GPS sports tracker, Amazfit, and
the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt, and my mobile phone. What's amazing is that
when using GPS on the phone, this rapidly drains the battery. The
tailored devices last much longer with GPS enabled. My Amazfit Watch
has at least 20 hour of continuous GPS coverage, the Bolt 13 hours (I
wonder whether something's wrong with mine, as the [official
figure](https://eu.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/gps-elemnt-bolt?rmsrc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwitPnBRCQARIsAA5n84mhRR7GV7efAaEyTasCsak1ugowYmVdoF6QZxjE7zY184vWRxHrunEaAljoEALw_wcB)
is much higher at 15 hours), my mobile running Strava maybe 8 hours.

> I am not a GPS specialist and I do not know how accurate the
  calibration of Google Earth images is. We should use Google Earth's
  images as a reference for the shape of the track, and only in case
  of stark deviations as an absolute reference.

Actually, back off a bit: I found [this interesting
study,](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3846/20296991.2017.1330767)
in which researchers tried to find out this exact question in 2017 --
it turns out that the offset in the city of Montreal (which ironically
I came back home from yesterday) is anywhere from 0.1 to 2.7 meters.

> Which device would do better? The specific GPS-trackers, or the
  mobile which has the benefit of triangulation?

> The Elemnt Bolt and Amazfit Stratos were relatively similar. The
  mobile was significantly worse.

I was pretty surprised by the relatively bad performance of the
phone. I would be interested to hearing how better phones do.
