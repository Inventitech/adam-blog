**Today was simple: I did not have much time, but wanted to prepare
  for the possible upcoming Time Trial I want to ride.**

So I added the tri-bars and went out for a one-hour ride. I think, in
hindsight, I should do these 1-hour efforts more often, as I think,
utlimately, they definitely aid in building fitness. But then often I
think "uh, but a one-hour bike ride, how much does that help anyway?"
and don't do it.

I should change that and just do it.

Tot zo,
