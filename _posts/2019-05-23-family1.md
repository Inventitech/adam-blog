**The purpose of today's trip was simple: Filling some gaps on our
  cycling map. In particular, we had not left many marks on the east
  of the Netherlands. Alternatively, we considered to join an
  organized 100km tour around Middleburg, but because of better
  weather in the east, decided to go to and cycle from Enschede right
  by the German border to [Arnhem](/arnhem). Ironically, that got us
  into some really nasty weather in the last 15 minutes of our ride.**


Servus,
