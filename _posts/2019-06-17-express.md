**As I mentioned in [yesterday's blog post](/monster), my mum and
  sister came to Den Haag to say good bye before we left for the
  US. Nora, being the sports person she is, did not come alone, but
  brought her race bike with her. That meant we had to use the nice
  weather in the evening to get the first training session in!**

Coming from a succsesful museum (for her) and US embassy day for me,
we took the train home after walking through Amsterdam. Nice
coincidence was that as we were strolling through the ever-busy
streets of NOT the Dutch capital, I randomly found that we were next
to a restaurant we wanted to have dinner at on Thursday. The place
looked rather good, so I popped in and made the reservation on the
spot (spoiler: we did not regret it).

Nora and I decided to do a quick loop to Leiden and back before dinner
was ready at home. And, wow, can Nora ride a bike! Not only did she
sit well in my wind shade, but she also did strong pulls at the
front. I think in the mountains, I would stand no chance.

> Well, good thing we are in the Netherlands.

On the way, we were overtaken by an older gentleman on a race bike
with aero bars. As we were thinking he would pull away, I was able to
smoothly close the gap and hold the group together. He was not too
talkative, though.


Tot zo,
