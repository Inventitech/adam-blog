**Today was the day on which Jorrin,
  [Floris](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24637929) and I headed up to
  the North, to Jorrin island, near Den Helder. Looking at the
  weather, storms were predicted for the late afternoon, so we agreed
  upon an early start (which I missed by some 10 min, sorry guys). It
  was really nice to ride such a long distance with a bit of speed in
  mind. Even though, if we really wanted to push it, there was lots of
  potential for optimization: Shorter pulls on the front, staying more
  together on the hills, optimizing the track (we even had a severe
  gravel section for some time!). All in all, it was a great
  experience, complete with sleeping in a small shed on an island in
  Den Helder.**

After a slowish start, we got into a good rhythm and did our second
breakfast in the pancake house in Noordwijk, about 20km into the
ride. Having lived in London for quite some time, Jorrin naturally
ordered an English breakfast, which came complete with a homeopathic
dose of beans.

In Zandvoort, there was again some kind of racing going on, we suspect
the GT3 series. This first part of the route, until IJmuiden (note how
"I" and "J" are both in capitals as they are pronounced as a
diphthong), I knew pretty well. It is really nice, with mostly good
asphalt, and if you have not seen this part of Holland, you would not
necessarily believe that such a landscape can be part of "the
flatlands", with its high dunes, and dessert-like stripes. But all of
it has a certain touch of being planned or "managed" to it.

That would change a bit as we got further north, where the dunes feel
rougher. Unfortunately, so did the road, which for the most part was
made out of these little red bricks that are also the facet of many
Dutch houses. Nothing terrible to ride on like really bad cobbles, but
annoying enough. I am sure they make you go 2km/h slower at least. As
we more got onto the shoreline, the rough north with the man-made high
dikes turned its rugged face to us, a landscape shaped by ebb and
flow, by high winds, and the everlasting fight against the sea.

> In the last 30km, Jorrin and Floris were absolutely drilling it on the
flats

I did not have anything to eat with me in my jersey, so I had to call
for a stop of the train. After the stop and an energy gel, I was
sort-of okay again.

Then came the fun part: Drinking a fantastic beer at the Storm End
pub. As Jorrin promised, the pub "Storm aan zee" is right at the end
of the bike path. They serve their self-brewed dark beer, called
"Langejaap Bier." The Langejaap beer is named after the iconic red
iron fire tower a couple hundred meters away from the pub. It (the
beer) is really delicious and comes in half-liter servings. What a
refreshing difference from the rest of Holland! After we finished the
beer, the predicted storm came and we moved inside, where the somewhat
peculiar interior design of "Storm aan zee" greeted us (a toilet paper
roll fixed to the wall next to every table, to replace
napkins?). Naturally, as seconds, I went for an equally good
Radler. Since the pub served as the former base of the coast guard,
they also have a shower in the toilet, which we used to refresh
ourselves. I used toilet paper (see above) as a make-shift towel. It
is always good to have a "local" with you (like Jorrin), as otherwise,
I would not have set a foot in the pub. This is also where we
separated from Floris, who did an excellent job on his longest tour
thus far.

Unfortunately, the weather for tomorrow is predicted really bad, so it
is unlikely we will actually be riding over the Afsluitdijk. 

Tot zo,
