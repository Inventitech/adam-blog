**After our [first day out on the road in Franconia](/family1), today
  it was time to head back. But before that, we took them time to
  enjoy beautiful town of Veitshöchheim: Small streets, frame houses,
  and its famous Rokokogarden (free of charge).**

For breakfast, we found a nice cafe and shared some goodies
there. Somehow, when out cycling on a multi-day trip, few things are
as exciting as a good breakfast with some fresh coffee in the
morning. Then, we headed back to Schweinfurt, first again alongside
the Main and then via the [Werntalradweg](https://www.wernradweg.de)
(yes, this bike route actually has its own website!). It was quite the
route: Nice asphalt, far less populous than the Main route, and a bit
more spicy with quite a few height meters. I actually became quite
bored of cycling next to the river for the whole day yesterday, so the
change today was very welcome. Since we rode kind of a triangle, today
would be much shorter km-wise, but I would not necessarily say much
less intense, due to the climbs.

To cycle this route had been on the bucket list of my dad for some
time. While he knew the last 40-or-so km, he did not know the start,
so it was good to explore it all.

On the road, we stopped at a nice cafe for lunch. This was a
recommendation by dad, a spot he often visits with a friend of
his. The location was also somewhat particular: It lay at the end of a
street with a short, but super steep climb. It being Friday,
unfortunately, they had run out of all their lunch options: No more
soup, pasta, or salad. Which was a bit of a bummer, because we could
see the last of those dishes being served to a group of people on the
terrace, who I suspect have never done any sports before. So we
resorted to having some sandwiches made for us, and I topped it of
with a delicious cake.

After another fifteen km, in the town of Werneck, we stopped at the
manorial castle, which doubles as a psychiatiric clinc and
hospital. We ate even more cake there to get us those last kilometers
home (Nora was so glad as to occassionally share a piece of the Carot
cake that the friendly chef recommended us).

All in all, it was a fantastic trip that I (and I think everyone else)
enjoyed. A few take-aways:

- I think my dad would really be served well with some of these new
  fitness bikes that are essentially made for road biking, but are
  something between a race bike and a trekking bike.

- I should really get a new saddle for my mountain bike, that thing
has never been comfortable. I also realized how bad the bike fits me
-- when riding freehanded I almost missed the handle bar once because
it so much forward. I also saw that I have learnt a lot about bikes
lately, so I could McGiver a repair.

- It is really cool to have a family that is so cycling-enthusiastic
  that you can just do something like this.

- It was good to explore my old home like that -- I was amazed by the
  landscape and pretty impressed by the bikepaths (but then we chose
  the route for them, so I guess if you just go ride, you'll have a
  worse experience for sure). One thing Germany has to abandon is this
  idea of shared pedestrain/bike paths: It does not work. Going into
  Würzburg, we had one situation where a group of girls blocked the
  bike part of the path, we went around on the left, going on to the
  pedestrian section. However, there was a crazy E-Biker who kept
  going on the bike lane, meaning he passed us on our right. Well, we
  are not in Australia, baby! I never knew whether he crashed into the
  girls (I did not hear an impact sound), but it sure seemed like he
  wanted to teach everyone a lesson. [Ebikers](/intervals2) ...

- I already knew the food would be great, and so it was. The only
  disappointment was perhaps the coffee: I only had one great
  capuccino in those two days.

Servus,
