**Today was an active recovery day with Yoga. In fact, I did the
  longest Yoga workout I have ever done in my life, at 90 minutes. It
  was a really awesome and wholesome experience.**

> Previously I have secretly thought that Yoga videos showing people
  in interesting poses use some sort of next-level CGI and that no
  living person can actually assume these poses!

Well, today's workout under the guidance of my Yogi Timea convinced me
otherwise. We started it out with a couple of activating dog poses and
push-ups. After that, the session was basically three-split in classic
Yoga fashion: 1) Standing, 2) sitting, and 3) laying poses. Despite
taking such a long time, we skipped a lot of the more advanced poses
and stretches. I can only speculate how long it would have taken us to
complete everything. Anyway, at the end of the workout I was pretty
done but felt very relaxed at the same time.

Tomorrow will be an interesting day in which I will try out my new
bike computer, the [Wahoo Elemnt
Bolt](https://www.amazon.de/Wahoo-ELEMNT-BOLT-GPS-Fahrradcomputer/dp/B06XT3YX7T/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_nl_NL=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=NEMYW8UTPH6S&keywords=Wahoo+Elmnt+Bolt&qid=1555426371&s=gateway&sprefix=wahoo+%2Caps%2C200&sr=8-3)
for the first time!

So long,
