**Today was another of those Yoga/stretch days. In fact I did the
  longest Yoga workout I have ever done in my life, at 90 minutes. It
  was a really awesome and wholesome experience.**

> Previously I have secretly thought that Yoga videos showing people
  in interesting poses use some sort of next-level CGI and that no
  living person can actually assume these poses and have a smile on
  their face!

Well, today's workout under the guidance of my Yogi Timea convinced me
otherwise. We started it out with a couple of activating dog poses and
push ups. After that, the sessions was basically three-split in
classic Yoga fashion: 1) Standing, 2) sitting, and 3) laying
poses. Despite taking such a long time, we skipped a lot of (more
advanced) poses and stretches, so I can only wonder how long it would
take to complete everything.

Tomorrow will be an interesting day in which I will try out my new
bike computer, the Wahoo Elemnt Bolt for the first time!

So long,
