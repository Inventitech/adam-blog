**This week, I headed over the big pond to Montreal for
  [ICSE](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2019). I was invited to
  present at a student mentoring workshop there (to give advice to
  current and prospective PhD students, that was fun!) and to present
  our [paper on Blackchain-based Software
  Engineering](https://inventitech.com/publications/2019_beller_hejderup_blockchain-based_software_engineering.pdf).**

  to structured training.

At least I made good use of the gym in our hotel (I chose it
specifically for that reason ... and because it was cheap) and trained
there 4 times over the course of the week -- this is the most training
I could ever get in during an ICSE, I think. I never really trained
for longer than 1 hour, but I did some of that urgently needed
strength training and could get some intervals on the recumbent
ergometer.

That thing's power meter was way off, by the way. I barely managed to
do 130 Watts on it. Plus, I did not like the recumbent geometry. The
device had 41 (!) difficulty level, and I did my 60-second intervals
(depicted above) at level 21, pedaled in-between at level 7.

Still, a lot better than nothing.

During one of the ICSE presentations, I saw a slide that contained a
funny analogy to explain recommendation based on similarity: A person
who buys pizza, pasta, and coke might be a cyclist! Or, actually: you
would also recommend the coke to someone else who consumes pizza and
pasta, and they both turn out to be cyclists.

I don't know where the author got the pizza from (I don't think your
average cyclist eats pizza typically), but this is basically me! I had
to laugh quite hard.

Montreal, by the way, is a beautiful city. Fortunately, I had a bit of
time to explore it and fully enjoyed it. Including a bottle of Bec
coke, which is sweetend with Maple Syrup. If anything, slightly
sweeter than most other Artisan cokes (whose taste I would rate as
slightly on the sour side usually), but fantasticly delicious.

Tot zo,
