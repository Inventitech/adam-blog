**This week, I headed over the big pond to Montreal for
  [ICSE](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2019). I was invited to
  present at a student mentoring workshop there (to give advice to
  current and prospective PhD students) and to present our [paper on
  Blackchain-based Software
  Engineering](https://inventitech.com/publications/2019_beller_hejderup_blockchain-based_software_engineering.pdf).**

> Traveling and being in a new environment do not lend themselves well
  to structured training.

During one of the ICSE presentations, I saw a slide that contained a
funny analogy to explain recommendation based on similarity: A person
who buys pizza, pasta, and coke might be a cyclist! Or, actually: you
would also recommend the coke to someone else who consumes pizza and
pasta, and they both turn out to be cyclists. I don't know where the
author got the pizza from (I don't think your average cyclist eats
pizza typically), but this is basically me! I had to laugh quite hard.

At least I made good use of the gym in our hotel (I chose it
specifically for that reason ... and because it was cheap) and trained
there 4 times over the course of the week -- this is the most training
I could ever get in during an ICSE, I think. I never really trained
for longer than 1 hour, but I did some of that urgently needed
strength training and could get some intervals on the recumbent
ergometer.

That thing's power meter was way off, by the way. I barely managed to
do 130 Watts on it. Plus, I did not like the recumbent
geometry. Still, better than nothing.

Tot zo,
