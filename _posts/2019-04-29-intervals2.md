**I tend to like splitting up my training into two segments. Today, I
  did one before/during lunch, and then one in the evening.**

For my first training session of the day, I again started with
intervals. 'Cause I think for something to have a bit of an effect,
you have to do it quite a few times. So I again did my trusty 5 times
3 minute max efforts. I wasn't quite able to find the route from last
time (roadworks + time pressure + no navigation set + me trying to
find a brilliant shortcut), but found a street that was just long
enough to go all-out for 3 minutes, then turn and go the other
way. And so on. This time, my heart rate peaked at 175bpm, still 15
bpm [short of its supposed maximum](/intervals). But perhaps this kind
of effort (as opposed to say, a gradual power build-up) does not lend
itself toward maxing-out the heart rate. Either way, in the end, I was
pretty surprised I even did 27k! Wow! I did hold back just a little
bit, knowing there would be another ride in the
evening. Unfortunately, I arrived late for lunch, which caused some
distress.

Second part was to join the Lola Coffee's club women's group
ride. Yes. Women's.
