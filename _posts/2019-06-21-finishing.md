**So this is it, my final post on this blog. Timi and I leaving to the
  US, officially marks the end of this road cycling project. While
  these past 72 days have been quite the blast, I wanted to take the
  time to properly reflect back on them and draw a more nuanced
  conclusion.**

To be honest, overall, my feeling for this project was one of
mediocre success. That is because throughout, I had an underlying
feeling of pressure and stress. I think there were a couple of reasons
for this: We were working on a relocation to the US (waiting for our
visas to the US to get through and all the insecurity associated with
that), so I did not really have a definite end day for the project. In
fact, we only knew on June 22nd that we were going to leave for the US
the next day. Despite quitting my job, I still supervised a student
and occasionally connected to Uni. Moreover, I participated in a
one-week conference in Montreal, which left me with a week without
cycling, but [a lot of jet lag](/jetlag/). So, while 72 days initially
sounds abundant, time became quite precious fragmented
quickly. Finally, this blog cost time and energy, too. Apart from the
initial setting up of the blog, producing high-quality posts
consistently, was occasionally draining: Stopping to take pictures,
selecting pictures, editing pictures, writing, correcting spelling
mistakes, finding links ... all in all, a post like this one is about
3 hours worth of work for me. I am still glad I did record almost
every ride in writing and not just in Strava activities.

**What I did not accomplish**

* Participating in a race. I eyed the [Saltbommel
  Tijdrijderscup](https://salt-boemel.nl/), a series of shortish time
  trials in Zaltbommel, but having arrived from Montreal just the day
  before, I did not feel great. Looking at the average speed of the
  participants, I would have been slaughtered, I think.

* I did not go to the gym to do complementary strength
  training. Somehow, I struggled even doing enough cycling, so going
  to the gym was out of the question. I did do a few Yoga practices,
  and the progress in those was amazing.

* Riding over the Afsluitdijk. That bloody thing [got
  closed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg_xrVhUdWE) just days
  before I started this project! What a disappointment.

* I did not ride any of the Belgian classics (but did ride the Amstel
  Gold, so that kind of equalizes). Weather was not favorable, plus I
  rode over some hefty cobbles during one of the rides and did not
  feel too inspired of an entire day of doing just doing this. This is
  the thing I regret least, because I think those steep ramps would
  have required a different gearing, too.

Overall, I also felt like I could have cycled more. An average of
33km/day does not really sound a lot, but combined with the
constraints, all other things that were going on, and the weather
really not being nice (last year, spring and early summer was much
more pleasant in the Netherlands), I think it is still OK. Actually, I
thought in the beginning whether I should aim for 3000km, but doing a
bit of back-on-the-envelope math, that seemed quite realistic. What I
do regret is that I never really got into a standard routine of
putting on my gear and have completely standardized spots where I put
my things. Many times, this meant I was looking for my sun glasses,
helmet, Wahoo Elemnt Bolt (that one was really bad), ...

**What I did accomplish**

* I focused on 'social' rides with Timi, my family, and friends. I
  would not want to have missed any of those, and this really was the
  nicest part of this whole endeavor: Doing so many rides with Timi,
  with my dad and Nora (both together and separately), with Martin and
  Jorrin was core to this experience.

* I nicely filled my cycling map of the Netherlands. See a comparison
  of before and after the project. ![Mapping getting
  filled.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/map.gif)


* Riding the [iconic parts of the Amstel Gold race](/mm2) was just
  fantastic. Big thanks to Timi for the inspiration.

* I did get pretty fit, but comparing my stats to people who
  consistently cycle a lot showed me what specific fitness really is.

* I really started to understand how to ride a road bike (there is
  much more to learn of course!).

* Planning routes with Komoot and then riding them on my Wahoo Elemnt
  Bolt is just fantastic. The difference it makes in riding unknown
  areas is huge.

* I learned a lot about bike maintenance. Frankly, I thought I knew
  something before I started, but then I (practically) learned so much
  more during this project, be it newer technology such as 11-speed,
  tubeless tires, or just road-specifics like wrapping handle bar
  tape.
  
* I assembled a nice set of tools to replace cassettes, chains, and
  cog sets. I should be able to do almost all repairs on the bike (and
  have the appropriate tools, too).

* Gotten my behind pretty sore at the end of the project, so I am not
  saying it was not good to have some time to heal.

**What I will change next time**

Overall, this was a great experience. I think it would have helped if
I had entered on a higher fitness/biking level into the project.  I
should have started training more seriously way before the project
began, parallel to work, and then at one point make the switch and
suddenly find that I would have much more time for training. Well, I
definitely acquired that higher level throughout the project.

* I will likely not write a blog about it, and instead focus on
training.

* Go for shorter 1 or 2 hour rides more often. I skipped those a
couple of times because I had originally planned something longer and
did not have enough time to do that anymore.

* Have a detailed schedule. I did not have one mainly because I wanted
  to remain opportunistic about the weather.

* Do something crazy once in a while.

* Have better weather. ;)
