**So this is it. The end came quite unexpected, as it dawned on me
that my remaining vacation days more than make up for my remaining
working days. Moreover, my pipeline for work, was, well if not quite
empty, then surely as empty as it hadn't been in the past 5 years. I
even completed work for a presentation I have to do in two months. (I
better rehearse it again before the event.)**

I have quit my job as a post-doc at TU Delft (well, temporarily) to go
fulltime pro. Cycling pro. Well, unpaid amateur wanna-be-pro for two
months, to be precise, to fill a gap between jobs that resulted from
some visa delays. After doing a bit of mountainbiking during school, I
have become quite entrenched in road cycling in the last year, got a
very nice race bike from my mum and dad as a PhD present, and started
joining some tours.

So, what do I want to accomplish in these two months? Number one
priority, enjoy it. Next, is to get as fit as I can. When I say
getting as fit as possible, that means I'm not coming from nowhere,
but I'm also definitely some ways from being a good cyclist. According
to O2fit, at 52ml/kg/min, my VO2 max is just "very good" for my age
(30).

So, how do I break down the abstract goal of "as fit as possible" into
concrete goals? I want to ...

- take part in 1-2 time trials.
- fill the remaining spots on my Netherlands map.
- ride on the afsluitdijk around the Ijselmeer.
- explore the Belgian cobbles.

As I thought, similar to when I went to Sweden, people seemed to enjoy
reading my recollections. They will be inherently personal, but
hopefully, you can also get something out of them. Whether it is to
explore the beautiful nature, or to just see what I am up to. I plan
to post something every day, certainly all my rides, except for
perhaps when I have a rest day. So long,
