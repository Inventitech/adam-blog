**So this is it. The end came quite unexpected, as it dawned on me
that my remaining vacation days more than make up for my remaining
work days. Moreover, my pipeline for work, was, well if not quite
empty, then surely as empty as it hadn't been in the past 5 years. I
even completed work for a presentation I have to do in two months. (I
better rehearse it again before the event.)**

This was on purpose of course. I have quit my job as a post-doc at TU
Delft (well, temporarily) to go fulltime pro. Cycling pro. Well,
unpaid amateur wanna-be-pro for two months, to be precise, to fill a
gap between jobs that resulted from some visa delays. After doing a
bit of mountainbiking during school (and then doing nothing but
commute for basically 10 years), I became quite entrenched in road
cycling in the last year, got a very nice race bike from my mum and
dad as a present for my PhD, and started joining some tours.

So, what do I want to accomplish in these two months? Number one
priority, enjoy it. Next, is to get as fit as I can. When I say
getting as fit as possible, that means I'm not coming from nowhere,
but I'm also definitely some ways from being a good cyclist. According
to
[Firstbeat](https://www.firstbeat.com/en/consumer-feature/vo2max-fitness-level/),
at 52ml/kg/min, my VO2max is just barely "very good" for my age
(30). VO2max is the metric [that] describes the your bodyâ€™s maximum
ability to "bring oxygen into your body through your lungs, transport
it through your blood supply to your muscles." Essentially, it defines
one's cardiorespiratory fitness level.

So, how do I break down the abstract goal of "as fit as possible" into
concrete goals? I want to ...

- take part in 1-2 time trials.
- fill the remaining spots on my Netherlands cycling map.
- ride on the [Afsluitdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsluitdijk) around
  the Ijsselmeer.
- explore the Belgian cobbles.

Of course, being a *pro* athelete, while I will focus on cycling, this
is not all I plan to do. There are some concerns about overtraining. I
will certainly accompany my cycling with complementary workouts such
as stretches and strength training. Thus, I also plan to sign up at a
gym again. I do not have a fixed training regime yet and am not sure
whether I should commit to one, also because going outside cycling
kind of depends on the weather.

When I went to Sweden, people seemed to enjoy reading my
recollections. Moreover, recently, a couple folks asked me what I was
up to. Well, I can now point them to this blog! It will be inherently
personal, but hopefully, you can also get something out of it. Whether
it is to explore the beautiful nature, or to just see what I am up
to. I plan to post something every day, certainly all my rides, except
for perhaps when I have a rest day.

So long,
