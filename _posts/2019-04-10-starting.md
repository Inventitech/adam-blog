**So this is it. The end came quite unexpected, as it dawned on me
that my remaining vacation days more than make-up for my remaining
work days. Moreover, my pipeline for work, was, well if not quite
empty, then surely as empty as it hadn't been in the past 5 years. I
even completed work for a presentation I have to do in two months. (I
better rehearse it again before the event.)**

The taxi arrived at 5:55 in the morning to transport us to the airport. The
taxi driver was a bit upset looking at our baggage. Somehow he managed to push all our 8 luggages into his Tesla. 
With the stopover in Frankfurt airport the overall flight took around 14 hours. The continuous humming noise on the airplane caused me headache. There was a traffic jam at the airport so the border control took overall 3 hours. By the time we arrived to the Airbnb all I wanted is to put my head on a cushion and sleep. Poor Moritz had another flight to San Francisco where his bootcamp started. I wouldn’t be able to travel more that day.

My main mission for the first days was to find an apartment to stay. For the first 7 days we booked a not to great apartment on Airbnb as I would have liked to explore the neighborhood and make a better decision regarding the permanent housing option. However we had a cool view from the rooftop.

Seattle the home of the Space needle, Boeing, Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks is going to be our home for the next couple of months.

So, what do I want to accomplish in these two months? Number one
priority, enjoy it. Next, is to get as fit as I can. When I say
getting as fit as possible, that means I'm not coming from nowhere,
but I'm also definitely some ways from being a good cyclist. According
to
[Firstbeat](https://www.firstbeat.com/en/consumer-feature/vo2max-fitness-level/),
at 52ml/kg/min, my VO2max is just barely "very good" for my
age. VO2max is the metric [that] describes your body’s maximum ability
to "bring oxygen into your body through your lungs, transport it
through your blood supply to your muscles." Essentially, it defines
one's cardiorespiratory fitness level.

So, how do I break down the abstract goal of "as fit as possible" into
concrete goals? I want to ...

- take part in 1-2 time trials.
- fill the remaining spots on my Netherlands cycling map.
- ride on the [Afsluitdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsluitdijk) around
  the Ijsselmeer.
- explore the Belgian cobbles.

Of course, being a *pro* athlete, while I will focus on cycling, this
is not all I plan to do. There are some concerns about overtraining. I
will certainly accompany my cycling with complementary workouts such
as stretches and strength training. Thus, I also plan to sign up at a
gym again. I do not have a fixed training regime yet and am not sure
whether I should commit to one, also because going outside cycling
kind of depends on the weather.

When I went to Sweden, people seemed to enjoy reading my
recollections. Moreover, recently, a couple of folks asked me what I
was up to. Well, I can now point them to this blog! It will be
inherently personal, but hopefully, you can also get something out of
it. Whether it is to explore the beautiful nature or to just see what
I am up to. I plan to post something every day, certainly all my
rides, except for perhaps when I have a rest day.

So long,
