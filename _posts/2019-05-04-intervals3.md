**Today, I did some kind of triathlon: intervals, yoga, and running.**

Yep, and that's it. My legs felt pretty done during cycling and as if
they did not really want to respond, despite having two rest days last
week and as if I could not really get cadence I wanted. I did hit
175bpm, though, which is good. Despite the fact that it was not
raining when I went out, my bike got pretty dirty. Bugger.

Yoga was awesome. I did a [Yoga workout designed for
cyclist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWzRE1BiAvw). After Yoga, I
performed a few more extra stretches.

After these two training units, I went for a jog in the Haagse
Bos. Given that I was pre-fatigued, that "went" surprisingly
well. Actually, I am not sure I ever ran 5km this quickly (yes, I am a
lousy runner). So I was very happy when I got home to prepare dinner.

Tot zo,
