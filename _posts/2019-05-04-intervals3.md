**Today was intervals, yoga, and running.**

Yep, and that's it. I felt pretty done during cycling, despite having
two rest days last week and as if I could not really get cadence I
wanted. I did hit 175bpm, though, which is good. Despite the fact that
it was not raining when I went out, my bike got pretty dirty. Bugger.

Yoga was awesome. I did a [Yoga workout designed for cyclist](). After
Yoga, I performed a few more stretches.

Tot zo,
