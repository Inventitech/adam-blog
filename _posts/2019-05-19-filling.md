**The purpose of today's trip was simple: Filling some gaps on our
  cycling map. In particular, we had not left many marks on the east
  of the Netherlands. Alternatively, we considered to join an
  organized 100km tour around Middleburg, but because of better
  weather in the east, decided to go to and cylce from Enschede right
  by the German border to [Arnhem](/arnhem). Ironically, that got us
  into some really nasty weather in the last 15 minutes of our ride.**

We did not have any expectations for the landscape or the ride at
all. In fact, Timi even heard that people referred to this part of the
Netherlands as "boring". What followed really positively suriprised
us.

  you want on a casual Sunday bike tour

We did no less than three cafe stops (the spots along the route were
just too pictoresque), including a beautifully restored castle
surrounded by water, in which I ate an Oreo cookie ([Phil
Gaimon](https://twitter.com/philgaimon) would be proud).

> As planned, the weather turned out to be absoutley fantastic, and
  for the first time in a long time, I could ride in just my cycling
  jersey again.

We enjoyed the ride so much, we spontaneously decided to go for a
fancy dinner in the Hunting Lodge closeby Arnhem. Unfortunately, that
turned out to be a bad decision.

While their sun terrace is extremely idyllic (I almost want to say
unique in the Netherlands), their service and attitude was just
terrible. Depsite the name ("lodge"), the restaurant turned out to be
pretty upscale.  Realizing not all restaurants cater to cyclists in
lycra, I asked before taking a seat whether we might have dinner
there. They were happy to have our business (and the bikes nearby the
terrace), and from there, the trouble began. I absolutely do not
recommend the [Hutning Lodge](https://thehunting.nl/): The food, while
okay, isn't that great (including its presentation), the service
(especially by the owner) was really poor, the cuttlery wasn't
entirely clean, we were charged twice on a bottle of water the staff
failed to transfer inside during a thunderstorm.

Tot zo,
